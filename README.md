This is a page for 2048 game variant to be part of an article of Charged Magazine, managed by Stemm Comm VIP of Georgia Tech.
Site: (https://chargedmagazine.org/)

For this 2048, the game do not autogenerate a tile of 2 or 4 upon making a move, but rather based on time. 
The random generated tiles can be 2, 4, 8, or more based on the current tiles on the board. 
This make the game much harder to win.
